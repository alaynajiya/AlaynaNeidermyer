<!--Looks like you're ready to get making with Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator. Good luck. Let's remember a few basic things:

1. If you haven't worked through one of our Pitt Fuego introductory tools (Electrate Fuego or I Am...A Project in Becoming), please do so. They will give you the basic skills to use this webtext generator.
2. Pay attention to file management - keep your asset names simple and one word.
3. Make sure your assets names/file type match your code.
4. Describe all images and clearly label links and buttons for accessibility  purposes.
5. Consult W3 when our code is not working or you need it to do something more.
6. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z...
7. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<h2><b>Why Is My Name My Name?</b></h2>
  <h3>Alayna Jiya Neidermyer defines me. I love my name and I love where it comes from. The spelling of my first name is somewhat unique. It's spelled the way it's pronounced, which some people still don't get. My middle name is Indian, because I have to represent both my mom and dad. Jiya means "sweetheart" in hindi. While I don't think that specific name fits me, I like Alayna Jiya a lot. Neidermyer is german, which represents my dad. I used to hate it. It sounds very clunky. But I have grown to love it and feel that it's me. I am proud to be a Neidermyer, even if I potentially won't carry on the name. This link, <a href=http://howmanyofme.com/search/>how many of you are there</a>, will show you how many people share the same name in the United States. This website may not be the most reliable, but it is so interesting to look at. I was able to find that 1,685 people share my first name, making it the 4019th most popular first name. I also found that Neidermyer is the 150436th most common last name and only 125 people share it with me. That makes my name somewhat original. I like that, but I also don't mind sharing my name. As long as I am who I want to be, I am representing Alayna Neidermyer the way I want to. There is so much more to a name than is let on too. My family will forever be connected because of our initials. But no one would know that unless they know all of our names. It makes us all special, even if we have to share our name with others. We are not sharing our identity, only our name.</h3>
